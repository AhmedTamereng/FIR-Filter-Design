"FIR Filter Design Project involves creating a MATLAB-based digital filter design tool. The project includes the implementation of the windowed sinc FIR filter design method, allowing users to input the filter impulse response length and compare results using rectangular, Blackman, Chebyshev, and Kaiser windows. Additionally, the project entails the development of Least Squares (LS) and Weighted Least Squares (WLS) FIR filter design methods, with options for user input on filter length and desired frequency response points. In the WLS method, users can specify weights for pass band, transition, and stop band frequencies. The tool generates and plots the magnitude spectrum of the designed filters, offering users the flexibility to view responses in both linear and log scales."
